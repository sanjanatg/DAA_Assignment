# Merge Sort and Euclidean GCD Visualization

## Overview
This project provides visualizations for the Merge Sort algorithm on a linked list and the Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). The animations help users understand how these algorithms work step by step.

## Features
### Merge Sort Visualization
- Users can input a list of numbers separated by commas.
- The program converts the list into a linked list and displays bars representing the values.
- Clicking the "Merge Sort" button starts the sorting animation, showing how the list gets divided and merged.

### Euclidean GCD Visualization
- Users enter the number of values for which they want to compute the GCD.
- The program takes individual inputs for the numbers.
- The algorithm steps are displayed live as it computes the GCD.
- The final steps are shown in a separate section.
- "Pause" and "Resume" buttons allow users to control the animation.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing for GUI and animations

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Compile and run the `MergeSortLinkedListVisualizer.java` for merge sort visualization.
4. Compile and run `Euclidean_GCD.java` for GCD visualization.

## Usage
### Merge Sort
- Enter numbers separated by commas.
- Click "Merge Sort" to start the animation.

### Euclidean GCD
- Enter the number of values.
- Provide the individual values in the prompt.
- Observe the live steps and final results.
- Use "Pause" and "Resume" buttons to control the animation.
