# Euclidean GCD Visualization

## Overview
This project provides visualizations for the Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). The animations help users understand how this algorithm work step by step by displaying their intermediate processes in a user-friendly manner.

## Features
### Euclidean GCD Visualization
- Users enter the number of values for which they want to compute the GCD.
- The program takes individual inputs for the numbers.
- The algorithm steps are displayed live as it computes the GCD.
- The final steps are shown in a separate section for clarity.
- "Pause" and "Resume" buttons allow users to control the animation.
- The final computed GCD is highlighted for better visualization.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing for GUI and animations

## File Structure

Euclidean_GCD.java - Implements and animates Euclidean Algorithm for GCD

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Compile and run `Euclidean_GCD.java` for GCD visualization.

## Usage

### Euclidean GCD
- Enter the number of values.
- Provide the individual values in the prompt.
- Observe the live steps and final results.
- Use "Pause" and "Resume" buttons to control the animation.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the graphical representation with color changes during key steps.
- Allow users to manually input linked list values using a graphical interface.
- Add support for different sorting algorithms to compare their performances.
- Optimize animation performance for larger datasets.
