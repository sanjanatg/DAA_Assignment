# Merge Sort and Euclidean GCD Visualization

## Overview
This project provides visualizations for the Merge Sort algorithm on a linked list and the Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). The animations help users understand how these algorithms work step by step by displaying their intermediate processes in a user-friendly manner.

## Features
### Merge Sort Visualization
- Users can input a list of numbers separated by commas.
- The program converts the list into a linked list and displays bars representing the values.
- Clicking the "Merge Sort" button starts the sorting animation, showing how the list gets divided and merged.
- Provides a step-by-step breakdown of how elements are sorted.

### Euclidean GCD Visualization
- Users enter the number of values for which they want to compute the GCD.
- The program takes individual inputs for the numbers.
- The algorithm steps are displayed live as it computes the GCD.
- The final steps are shown in a separate section for clarity.
- "Pause" and "Resume" buttons allow users to control the animation.
- The final computed GCD is highlighted for better visualization.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing for GUI and animations

## File Structure
MergeSortLinkedListVisualizer.java - Implements and visualizes Merge Sort on linked lists

Euclidean_GCD.java - Implements and animates Euclidean Algorithm for GCD

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Compile and run the `MergeSortLinkedListVisualizer.java` for merge sort visualization.
4. Compile and run `Euclidean_GCD.java` for GCD visualization.

## Usage
### Merge Sort
- Enter numbers separated by commas.
- Click "Merge Sort" to start the animation.
- Watch as the list gets divided and merged in real-time.

### Euclidean GCD
- Enter the number of values.
- Provide the individual values in the prompt.
- Observe the live steps and final results.
- Use "Pause" and "Resume" buttons to control the animation.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the graphical representation with color changes during key steps.
- Allow users to manually input linked list values using a graphical interface.
- Add support for different sorting algorithms to compare their performances.
- Optimize animation performance for larger datasets.
